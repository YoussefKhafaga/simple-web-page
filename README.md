### Project description
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

this is a simple project that aims to make a web page dynamic using javaScript language.

The page creates a new section dynamically once the page is loaded it also creates a nav bar with list items inside an unorderd list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

When you scroll down you will see that the active section has set a special style to indicate that it is the active one according to the view port.

If you chose one of the list items section 1 to 4 it will get you smoothly right down to the section you chose.

I have added Light mode and dark mode you can switch between them through the link in the navigation bar.
